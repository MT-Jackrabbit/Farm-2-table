      <p><b>Mission Statement</b></p>
      <hr>
      <p>Farm-to-table is a phrase that can mean different things to different people. At its heart, farm-to-table means that the food on the table came directly from a specific farm, without going through a store, market, or distributor along the way. We strive to bring high quality products that were picked at peak freshness, bursting with flavor and vitamins.</p>
      <p>We believe that fostering a relationship between the farm and consumer is extremely important and beneficial to both parties. Not only do the farms receive local recognition for their hard work and guaranteed business, the consumer is able to obtain fresh seasonal produce and livestock.</p>
